# Assignment 2: Radiosity

Student name: Minttu Mäkinen
Student number: 356275

# Which parts of the assignment did you complete? Mark them 'done'.
# You can also mark non-completed parts as 'attempted' if you spent a fair amount of
# effort on them. If you do, explain the work you did in the problems/bugs section
# and leave your 'attempt' code in place (commented out if necessary) so we can see it.

R1 Integrate old raytracing code (1p): done
            R2 Area light source (3p): done
                    R3 Radiosity (6p): done

# Did you do any extra credit work?

(Describe what you did and, if there was a substantial amount of work involved, how you did it. If your extra features are interactive or can be toggled, describe how to use them.)

None.

# Are there any known problems/bugs remaining in your code?

(Please provide a list of the problems. If possible, describe what you think the cause is, how you have attempted to diagnose or fix the problem, and how you would attempt to diagnose or fix it if you had more time or motivation. This is important: we are more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what's going on.)

Not that I'm aware of.

# Did you collaborate with anyone in the class?

(Did you help others? Did others help you? Let us know who you talked to, and what sort of help you gave or received.)

I did go to the assignment sessions, so I guess the course assistants?

# Any other comments you'd like to share about the assignment or the course so far?

(Was the assignment too long? Too hard? Fun or boring? Did you learn something, or was it a total waste of time? Can we do something differently to help you learn? Please be brutally honest; we won't take it personally.)

The first round assignments took way more round than the second one. Would be nice if it was more even. Regarding the first question, the part with save/load hierarchy has not been implemented in the first round, and thus I've simply not used it for the excercises this round.
